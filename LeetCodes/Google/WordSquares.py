'''
Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them.

A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).

For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.

b a l l
a r e a
l e a d
l a d y
Note:
There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
All words will have the exact same length.
Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
Example 1:

Input:
["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]

Output:
[
  [ "wall",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ],
  [ "ball",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ]
]

Explanation:
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
Example 2:

Input:
["abat","baba","atan","atal"]

Output:
[
  [ "baba",
    "abat",
    "baba",
    "atan"
  ],
  [ "baba",
    "abat",
    "baba",
    "atal"
  ]
]

The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matter

def wordSquares(self, words):
    '''
    I try every word for the first row. For each of them, try every fitting word for the second row.
    And so on. The first few rows determine the first few columns and thus determine how the next row's word must start.
    For example:

    wall      Try words      wall                     wall                      wall
    a...   => starting  =>   area      Try words      area                      area
    l...      with "a"       le..   => starting  =>   lead      Try words       lead
    l...                     la..      with "le"      lad.   => starting   =>   lady
                                                                with "lad"
    For quick lookup, my fulls dictionary maps prefixes to lists of words who have that prefix.

    def build(square):
        if len(square) == n:
            squares.append(square)
            return
