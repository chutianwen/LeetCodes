'''
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes),
write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:
     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], return 2.

Example 2:
     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3
Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], return 1.

Note:
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as
[1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
